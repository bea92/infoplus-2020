Nevertheless, being non-quantifiable, such uncertainty is often overlooked in visualisations. In this talk we present two case studies within the digital humanities in which we encountered and then examined how to integrate qualitative uncertainty in our visualisation designs. Using these cases as a starting point we discuss how uncertainty visualisation should be understood within its socio-technological context, propose that interaction design patterns can perhaps help design for it and call for the further development of participatory activities specifically catered for understanding qualitative uncertainties.",paper,watch the video,,

Communicating this uncertainty is critical for building appropriate trust, but is often achieved through simple, cumulative encodings that may obfuscate uncertainty’s underlying complexity. Our work is aimed at exploring how and what uncertainty measures should be presented to different stakeholders. Through several examples, we describe how different sources of uncertainty and different stakeholders of machine learning systems require different visual representations of uncertainty. Finally, we begin disentangling underlying dimensions of domains, models, and stakeholders that motivate this heterogeneous treatment.",paper,watch the video,,

Before the June primaries, a civic education effort used various tools to explain the new ballot design and accompanying vote-counting system to the city’s diverse electorate. After the election, government and news graphics showed the results from dozens of contests encompassing hundreds of thousands of votes. This paper evaluates RCV tools from educational campaigns and news media in terms of clarity, precision, and accuracy. We identify three criteria for successful graphics and present an interactive simulator that illustrates their importance for informed voters and transparent elections.",paper,watch the video,,

The value of feminist theory as a how-to guide for design principles is critical and necessary, but we believe there is more work that theory can do. Specifically, feminist theory is a lens we can use to better characterize interaction with visualizations to understand how knowledge is gained, along with generative ways to expose systems of power entangled with it. We present our process for engaging with feminist theory, preliminary results, and our speculations for future feminist visualization research.",lighting-talk,watch the video,,

limitations in urban data","Many critiques of visualisation(s) derive from the presentation of data as static and given representations of phenomena within seamless interfaces. In this talk, I’ll examine alternative representations of an urban tree data visualisation guided by the principle of pluralism. Together, these exploratory representations build a richer picture by revealing limitations and otherwise hidden qualities of these data. I’ll talk about what we can learn about the data and the represented trees through this approach and suggest key considerations for critical urban data visualisation(s) that are highlighted by this work.",lighting-talk,watch the video,,

Using content analysis, we examine how these tensions manifest in the work of data_labe, a narrative online news outlet based on Complexo da Maré in Rio de Janeiro. Observing the presence of three narrative patterns connected to strategies of emotional resonance we showcase how data_labe’s production aesthetically re-signify failures of the data collection. We further discuss how this use of data visualization challenges the ideology of neutrality that permeates the mainstream discourse about the role of data representation in journalism.",lighting-talk,watch the video,,

This presentation from the Living with Machines project explores combining the two, visualising a dataset of 130,000 maps from the early Ordnance Survey (OS), Britain’s national mapping agency. It was the OS who, from the early 19th century, created the first comprehensive, detailed and accurate picture of Great Britain. We show how animated data graphics can bring the story of the maps to life for a popular audience. We also visualise the data by space and time to support analysis in research.",paper,watch the video,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/12QLwK3VrQYIN41GPcUVHSE2QpuUns79b/view?usp=sharing

Undertaken as part of the Chronotopic Cartographies research project, an experimental practice-led enquiry was used to generate 'temporal' topographic landscapes - interactive 3D environments which visualise the spatial and temporal relationships which emerge over the course of a narrative as a dynamic topographic terrain. The paper will present an overview of the process, outcomes and initial user feedback - in order to demonstrate the potential of this approach as a new model for visualising and analysing the spatial and temporal qualities of literary texts.",paper,watch the video,,

How we perceive, understand and interpret sound is closely aligned with systems of power, which is particularly evident in how we define, interpret and respond to noise. This presentation examines noise complaints as an instrument of sonic warfare by examining complaints made in gentrifying areas of New York, in particular, in historically Black and Latinx neighborhoods, areas that are undergoing significant socioeconomic change, and/or are located near mainly white neighborhoods.",lighting-talk,watch the video,,

The methodology involves documenting the spatial structure of craft-based cities through the lens of task connectivity theory (assuming each task as a step in the production cycle of bangle making) using graph theory, charting each node as the centre of the task performed. The resultant connections determine the flow of goods or services between these centres. The output can assist in an insightful visual interpretation of existing socio-economic structures to shape urban policies and further be used to simulate scenarios for informed future developments.",lighting-talk,watch the video,,

Revealing the realities of visualisation workflows and design opportunities for visualisation tools.,"This talk presents demos of prototype visualisation tools, developed in response to user-research that investigated how R users, working in and around ‘data science’, visualised their data. Our semi-structured interviews and diagramming activity revealed how visualising data 1) involves frequent, interwoven learning activities to understand data, design possibilities, end-users, techniques and tools, 2) foraging for learning resources away from the visualisation itself, and 3) developing visualisations that enable learning whilst visualising data. Two of the prototypes account for these demands on visualisation practice, and the third enables future user research, but from a distance, via an automated archiving tool.",paper,watch the video,,

It is too expensive to do anything different with digital. And when it comes to informing, being different is how we attract and engage our audience’s attention. Before digital, data visualization presented a diverse array of information design solutions.

However, traditional media houses still struggle with integrating such interactive methods into their reporting. At the Swiss daily “Neue Zürcher Zeitung”, we used design research methods to establish a repository that enables journalists to work with a shared vocabulary around scrollytelling. This repository describes various scrollytelling techniques, and contains a collection of tools – self-built and from third parties – to implement these techniques. At Info+, we present learnings from our research process and showcase the scrollytelling repository and some of the articles that have come from it.",lighting-talk,watch the video,,

How does a multifaceted team expand this scope by harnessing the power of visualization as a tool to think with?  The NASA JPL/Caltech/ ArtCenter data visualization program demonstrates how scientific knowledge, shaped from data and theory, is equally co-constructed from diverse human perspectives. 
We will share case studies from Mars Rover Path planning and PIXLISE, a visual reasoning tool for understanding planetary geology. Working from source data through mixed media artifacts, these projects demonstrate co-design methods for complex scientific domains with real-world applications. Our methodology emphasizes that all participants in the co-design process are both learners and experts. In this dynamic, the design and coding process are unique modes of critical discovery.

In design education, a critique is a class session where designers present their work-in-progress and receive feedback from faculty, peers, and invited critics. In this study, we show that an intervention consisting of 1) an introduction to visual principles,  2) an explanation of critique methodology,  and 3) participation in a group critique led to a significant increase in both the quantity and quality of feedback that scientists provided on a set of figures. These findings confirm that critiques are a valuable practice for scientists to integrate into research labs.",lighting-talk,watch the video,,

After a brief history of the major influences on the development of face-based scale illustrations and aesthetics, I review each of the most prominently used face-based scales in late twentieth and early twenty-first century medical care and research. I ultimately argue that the graphic pain scale is a critical category of technique and a core component of pain medicine—and thus is a core component of the ways that pain came to be understood and communicated by medical professionals and by people in pain since the late 20th century.",paper,watch the video,,

With self-administered rapid tests, patients collect their sample, process it, and get their results within the hour. For testing to be effective, the quality of instructions is as important as technical accuracy. This cross-disciplinary project addresses issues that influence the reliability of COVID-19 lateral flow tests operated by lay people.

Should we wash our hands? Wear a mask, and/or a visor? What if we were outside? Talking loudly? Singing? 
We wanted to make an interactive visual tool that would give people immediate feedback on the impact of protective measures they can take. However, we faced several challenges.
This talk will explain how we dealt with lack of evidence, presenting uncertainty, and managing the relationship between designers, researchers, and journal editors. We describe a new working model that will be explored further in future.

Organizations and advocacy groups across the country are working to address this urgent crisis. In Arkansas, the maternal death rate is the fourth highest in the nation. Studies show that alternative birthing options (such as doulas, midwifery, and birth centers) lower the risk of tragic outcomes, but are not equally accessible or well known. Design has the potential to untangle the complexities of birth, and dismantle oppressive systems. Alongside a group of birth workers, we formed the Northwest Arkansas Birth Collective, a non-profit organization investing resources into supporting local birthing persons. This work includes parsing through scattered and complicated data, and reinterpreting it for the public.
